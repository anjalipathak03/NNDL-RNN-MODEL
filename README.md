# RNN-model

- Recurrent neural network is a type of neural network in which the output form the previous step is fed as input to the current step
- In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but this is not a good idea if we want to predict the next word in a sentence
- We need to remember the previous word in order to generate the next word in a sentence, hence traditional neural networks are not efficient for NLP applications
- RNNs also have a hidden stage which used to capture information about a sentence
- RNNs have a ‘memory’, which is used to capture information about the calculations made so far
